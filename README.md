Credit Card Customer Churn Prediction (ANN Model)

This project builds an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict customer churn using the Credit Card Customer Churn dataset from Kaggle.

Key steps included:

Data preprocessing (cleaning, encoding, scaling)

Splitting into training & testing sets

Building and training an ANN with Keras & TensorFlow

Evaluating model performance with accuracy score

Making predictions for new customer data
