#  Credit Card Customer Churn Prediction (ANN Model)

This project builds an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** to predict customer churn using the **Credit Card Customer Churn dataset** from Kaggle.

##  Key Steps
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning, encoding, and scaling  
- **Train/Test Split:** Dividing the dataset into training & testing sets  
- **Model Building:** Creating an ANN with Keras & TensorFlow  
- **Model Evaluation:** Checking accuracy on test data  
- **Prediction:** Making predictions for new customer input
